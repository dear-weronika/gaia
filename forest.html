          <h1>Deforestation </h1>
      </h3>
      <p>Climate change increase risks to forest through hurricanes, drought, ice storms, pest         outbreaks and the occurrence of invasive species, air pollution.
          he biggest problem already faced by forests is Deforestation is one of the main contributors to climate change. It comes in many forms: wildfire, agricultural clearcutting, livestock ranching, and logging for timber, among others. Forests cover 31% of the land area on Earth and annually 75,700 square kilometers of forest is lost. 
          One of the powerful climate solutions is restoring forests. Adding 2.2 billion acres of tree cover would capture two-thirds of man-made carbon emissions.</p>
        <h1> Amazon Forest</h1>
        <p>The Amazon rainforest has long been recognized as a repository of ecological services. It is also the only rainforest that we have left in terms of size and diversity.Models suggest that by the year 2050, temperatures in the Amazon will increase by 2–3°C. At the same time, a decrease in rainfall during dry months will lead to widespread drying. 
        There are serious consequences to these changes. Projected increases of temperatures and decreased rainfall during already dry months could result in longer and perhaps more severe droughts, along with substantial changes in seasonality. 
        What should we expect?
        Coupled with land-use changes, we can expect the degradation of freshwater systems, loss of ecologically and agriculturally valuable soils, increased erosion, decreased agricultural yields, increased insect infestation, and spread of infectious diseases.
            Between 30% and 60% of the Amazon rainforest could become a dry savanna
